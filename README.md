# Introduction
During my time at the Technical University of Varna, I had the opportunity to work on various programming exercises and projects. This repository showcases my work and the skills I acquired during my studies, particularly in the areas of OOP, Programming Basics with C++, and Web Programming with PHP.

# Folder Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders, each representing a different area of study:

- `OOP` - This folder contains projects and exercises related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. Here, you will find implementations of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and other OOP concepts.

- `Programming-Basics-With-C++_Project` - This folder contains my first semestral project, a console application for a tennis tournament. It was implemented using C++ and demonstrates my understanding of basic programming concepts such as control flow, data structures, and file handling.

- `Web-Programming-With-PHP` - This folder contains projects and exercises related to web programming using PHP.
